# Don't want to think about git commit history but have some green fill it and impress potential employers?

## Let this program do the job for you and you take care of more important stuffs! 

## Make sure you have rsa key to be able to perform git operations

## Make sure you have personal access token to be able to push to your remote and use git api

`g++ dailycommit.cpp && ./a.out`mamamia!

When you execute dailycommit.cpp, you will have to input passphrase for the rsa token you set up unless you omitted doing so.

So automation perspective, better not have that passphrase but i think it wouldn't be impossible to automatically insert that passphrase. 

Listen for the event of script being executed, then execute insert script? Let's try! haha fun coding.
